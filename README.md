CSE 524 Paediatric Emergency Response Web Forms

The Paediatric Emergency Medical Record defines different types of functionalities that can be used by the scribe in the Medical Emergency Room for efficient and fast form filling.

The design of the forms shall enable ease of form filling and also shall enable the scribe to fill the form in a time efficient manner.

The different functionalities involve entering the information from a live emergency situation into a device or a web application through a computer using an operator who either is the scribe or another person who is a part of the emergency situation.

The different screens provide an insight into the entire form filling process and provide a rich user interface to the user to fill the details and also to capture and store data.

Screens:-

1. New EMR Entry
2. Primary Survey
3. Seconday Survey
4. Vital Signs
5. IV Fluids
6. Medications
7. Procedures
8. Lap Reports/Diagnostic Reports

There are certain additional information screens that include Mechanism of Injury as well as Psychosocial information as well.

Another important functionality that has been introduced is the timeline view.
The timeline view presents a complete picture to the user to depict the timeline of the different activities that enable any authorized user to recreate the entire emergency scenario. Since the earlier process relied on the memory of the involved medical staff to recreate the exact process, it introduced human error, but by automating the process of recording the time of these events , the occurences can be recorded successfully without any error thus improving the quality of the entire input process. 

Amongst some of the back-end technologies explored was NodeJS. NodeJS provides an easy interface to the front-end JS libraries and the charting libraries. The NodeJS has different methods like routes that enable different routes for separate GET requests. The different functionalities can be modularized in the form of separate functions that can be extended or modified as required.
